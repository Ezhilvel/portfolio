### Background & Analysis

The Retail Co. manufacturers and sells sports apparels. Around 50% of the purchases online were attributes to items on sale. Close to 85% of customers were identified as one time shoppers (Might be biased due to high volume of guest checkouts). Around 2/3rd of the orders were less than 3 items.

## Projects


### [Causal Estimation of Effectiveness of Promotions](https://ezhilvel.github.io/portfolio/causalml/)

Retail Brands have promotions running on products throughout the year. Due to the complexity in terms of the number of products, a variety of offers, and the absence of structured experiments, it's difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of promotions. We built a machine learning model to quantify this using historical sales data and CausalML.

### [Identifying Outdated User Profiles]()

A causal study on the profile updates (such as job switch) and the network interaction showed that timely updates lead to connecting with 1.5x more users outside the network than a one month delayed update. And 60% of users did not update their profile within one month of a job switch. Built an end-to-end pipeline to identify the outdated user profiles on the platform.

### [Revenue Optimization using Media Mix Model]()

A typical retail company invests around 10% of sales revenue into future marketing initiatives. The Marketing/Media Mix Model (MMM) provides the return on spend for these initiatives. However, the raw data needs to be transformed into ad-stock transforms to ensure the delayed effect and the response saturation are captured.

### [Patient Readmission Prediction]()

If a patient is re-admitted to a medical facility where he was treated, for the same complaint within the 60 days of their discharge, it is flagged as re-admission. Medical facilities within the US that have a re-admission rate above the national average are penalized. We built a solution to predict in advance, at the time of discharge, the propensity for the patient to be re-admitted. Also, local variable importance, using Shapley value provides detailed insights into 
the prime factors could be addressed to potentially prevent readmission.
